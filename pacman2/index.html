    <h2>Pirates vs Knights</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I created the entire map layout, the game takes many different styles 
and genres and makes one game.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game includes animation as well as a simple inventory system that can select items.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a lot of javascript, having known very little.  The hardest part was making everything work together.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I borred from a few sources:
<ul>
<li>Video Guide for Basic Setup: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdXcD9X4NrQ&t=258s&ab_channel=MorganPage">Video</a></li>
<li>Characters: <a href="https://superdark.itch.io/16x16-free-npc-pack">Character Sprites</a></li>
<li>Items: <a href="https://cheekyinkling.itch.io/shikashis-fantasy-icons-pack">Other Item Sprites</a></li>
<li>Phaser: <a href="https://kaylousberg.itch.io/gun-assets?download">Phaser Sprites</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game is based on Pacman so Pacman.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A topdown arcade style game with a pirate collecting rubys and fighting knights.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Challenge (theme) used: Audio is required to play. 
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: keyboard, Randomness: a lot of randomness, Play Style: Collector, Genre: Overhead 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is using keyboard controls to make a simple topdown collecting game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should get a rewarding experience by collecting all of the rubies without being killed by the knights.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
Players can move using WASD.  Players can use their phaser using a mouse click, but primary input is keyboard WASD.  More information about the phaser must be gleaned from the audio.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players should avoid the knights at all costs. They have extremely high health, while the pirate has very low health.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game takes place with a pirate stuck in a dungeon with four knights.  The knights are tasked with protecting the rubies at all costs. The pirate is seeking the thrill of the adventure, and plans to steal the treasure (the rubys).  The pirate must face down the knights and steal the treasure.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Target Audience is players who want a short game that is fun and engaging.
</li>

Between 2 and 5 minutes.
