    <h2>The Mall</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game is based on my first iteration. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I added the ability to add player names.  Player names and health are displayed on the screen and update as players take damage.
<ul>Player names now appear in the text rather than "player 1"</a></ul>
<ul>The fight scene against the king considers player health, player weapons, and randomness to decide if they win or lose</a></ul>
<ul>Before, the king fight scene was dependend on the first or section option</a></ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I wanted to add gifs or short videos like in the Oregon Trail where scenes have short gifs that play. 
<ul>It seems gifs are not supported by phaser or at least that's what I could find. </a></ul>
<ul>I could have added a video but I could not find a video that worked for my needs.</a></ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Assets are the same as the last iteration with the exception of the cobra.
<ul>Cobra<a href="https://www.pngfind.com/download/omJwoh_600-x-600-1-transparent-background-cartoon-cobra/">Picture</a></ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game style is based on the Organ Trail.  The other game that is similar to this is the previous iteration.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A group of travelers travels throught an mall in Sedona, Arizona trying to find food and survive the Mall.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Challenge (theme) used: Multiple Players required to play.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This iteration I got player names and player health to work, as well as displaying the players names and health on each scene.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should begin to understand the story and think through each of their decisons.  
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Two to four players are required.  Players assign themselves a number between one and four.  Players begin with a health of three.  If a player takes damage, they take one damage point.
<ul>The players have to agree on an option before proceeding, on one player should make the decision.</a></ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players should take their time and consider their options.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game takes place in Sedona, Arizona with a group of travelers in search for food.  They discover a mall they believed to be abandonded, but rather encourter a tribe that they must face off with.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players who enjoy a simplistic game with an enjoyable and original storyline.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Play time is between 5 and 20 minutes.
</li>
<li><strong>Version: 2.0.0</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>Known Bugs</strong>
Options with long text have to be clicked on the bottom row of the text. Clicking on the top rows of the text do nothing.
