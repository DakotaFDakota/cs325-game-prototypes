    <h2>Shopping Cart Return</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I have never played a game about returning shoppoing carts so I guess its fairly original.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game has a timer that took way too much effort to get working.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I should do more research on Phaser vs Javascript before going all in on how one of them can do something.  They have strenghts and weeknesses for both.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I created the map by myself using Gimp.
<ul>The shopping carts asset can be found <a href="https://icons-for-free.com/shopping+cart-131964743721771194/">here</a></ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
 I'm not sure what this game is similar to, I wanted to do a frogger style cart return game with cars to avoid, but did not have the time.
 <ul>Previous iteratation of game: <a href="https://dakotafdakota.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/game2/">Game</a></ul>
 <ul>See "patch notes section" for changes</ul>

</li>
