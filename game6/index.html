    <h2>The Mall</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The entire story line was created by me.  I designed each possible and step you can take and drew the button the first screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game uses a number of scenes to switch between "levels". Each possible option leads the player to a new scene which has its own text and options.
<ul>The scenes can pass information between them. For example, if you pick up the crowbar, you keep the crowbar for the duration of the game</a></ul>
<ul>and having the crowbar on a later level is beneficial.</a></ul>
<ul>There are elements of randomness, which player will take damage from an incident that causes damage.</a></ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I want to have the game take in players names and keep track of players health, rather than outputting "player 1", or "player with the least amount of health."
<ul>I want to have the game display player's name and health on the scene.</a></ul>
<ul>I plan to add some pictures to the game every once in a while to spice up the scenes so they are not all plain text.</a></ul>
<ul>I plan to change some the color of the text between the game text and the options so they do not blend together.</a></ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I created the button on the first scene.
<ul>The win game music, Sedona by Houndmouth<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8wifV5RYr8&ab_channel=HoundmouthVEVO">Youtube</a></ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game style is based on the Organ Trail.  The game also has the same style as Dungeons and Dragons, with the game acting as the Dungeon Master.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A group of travelers travels throught an mall in Sedona, Arizona trying to find food and survive the Mall.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Challenge (theme) used: Multiple Players required to play.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This game gave me an oppurtunity to work with multiple scenes, as well as passing data between scenes.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should begin to understand the story and think through each of their decisons.  
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Two to four players are required.  Players assign themselves a number between one and four.  Players begin with a health of three.  If a player takes damage, they take one damage point.
<ul>The players have to agree on an option before proceeding, on one player should make the decision.</a></ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players should take their time and consider their options.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game takes place in Sedona, Arizona with a group of travelers in search for food.  They discover a mall they believed to be abandonded, but rather encourter a tribe that they must face off with.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players who enjoy a simplistic game with an enjoyable and original storyline.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Play time is between 5 and 20 minutes.
</li>
<li><strong>Version: 1.0.0</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>Known Bugs</strong>
Options with long text have to be clicked on the bottom row of the text. Clickign on the top rows of the text do nothing.
