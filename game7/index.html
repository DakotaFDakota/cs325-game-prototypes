<ul>
<li><strong>Link to Game on ITCH:</strong>
<ul>Link to game:<a href="https://dferris216.itch.io/thechickenfarmer">ITCH.IO</a></ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This game has Pokemon style fights, but the interaction with the world is a first person style.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game switches between 2D and 3D.
<ul>The game generates the appropriate character depending on which one you interact with.</a></ul>
<ul>The health bar has smooth decrease</a></ul>
<ul>The text is added like its being typed, rather than just appearing</a></ul>
<ul>The menus can be navigated using the arrow keys and space bar with the highlighted text, rather than just clicked on</a></ul>
<ul>I had to learn C# as unity scripts are all in C# and I knew no C#</a></ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I would have liked to add 3D and 2D animations
<ul>I spent too much time on the 2D fight scene and not enough on the first person/ 3D aspect of the game</a></ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
The assets are from the unity asset store.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game is based on Pokemon, at least in terms of the fight scenes.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You play a farmer who is trying to get their chickens back from the animals that stole them.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Honestly producing anything in Unity was my goal.  This was my first attempt at anything Unity so with this game I just wanted to learn.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Player should fight the enemy animals and get back their chickens.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players use WASD and mouse to move the FP model and arrow keys and space to navigate the 2D menus
<ul>Player also uses F to interact with 3D objects</a></ul>
<ul>Player interacts with the animals to fight them and destrying all 3 gets their chickens back</a></ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players should mix up the moves they get to do the most damage.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game takes place on a farm with a farmer who is trying to get their chickens back from the evil animals that stole them.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players who want an easy to play game that does not require a great deal of work.  Players can relax and play. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Play time is between 5 and 10 minutes.
</li>
<li><strong>Version: 1.0.0</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>Known Bugs</strong>
The first fight, the text does not display correctly.  It overlays the text from two menus at once. After this fight, it is fixed.  Just click space to fight and it will fix itself.
</li>

<li><strong>Unity over Phaser</strong>
I chose to try Unity over phaser for this iteration because I have heard very good things about Unity, but never had an oppurtunity to try to make a game with it. This was that oppurtunity.
<ul>I think Unity's strenght is how powerful it is, able to do 3D rendering, however, it is much more complicated to learn, even simple things.</a></ul>
<ul>Unity is also more difficult to export, at least to github. I had issues with the filesize being too big and spent over 2 hours trying to repair my github after I broke everything</a></ul>
<ul>Uploading to itch.io fixed some issues, but does not change the fact that unity is not suited well for some web based purposes</a></ul>
