    <h2>The Mall</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game is based on the the kids toy that plays animal sounds.  This version is based on the toy in on the Family Guy episode "Road to Germany"  
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
This game plays different sounds based on the image clicked.  Additionally, it spins the arrow to a random angle when the button is pressed.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I would get the arrow to spin smoothly and have the sound play when the arrow points to the animal.  
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I created the map by myself using Gimp.
<ul>The audio from the Family Guy episode used: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MTn8sP_9s">Youtube</a></ul>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
 This game is based on the kids toy that spins an arrow and teaches kids the sound the animal makes.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Learn the sounds animals make, but it is the wrong sounds.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Challenge (theme) used: Round and Round - the spinnig arrow. Chimera - players can write down or verbalize what animal they think the arrow will land on.  Additionally, players can guess the sound the animals will make.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Mouse, Randomness: a lot of randomness, Play Style: Joker, Genre: Learning/Educational
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This game creates a better understanding of audio in games.  It also helped me learn how to individualize functions to different objects (ie different sounds played for different animals).  I also dipped my feet into rotation of images.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should learn the sounds the animals make. Additionally, they should get a laugh if they are familar with the episode of Family Guy this is based on.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players can guess where the arrow will land and what sound they think the animal will make, if they choose to.  Play will click the button at the top right and click on the animal the arrow points to.  If the arrow is on the line, player will click the button again.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
No strategies, just have fun and learn.
</li>

Players is a child learning animal sounds.  Perhaps the player is a character in Family Guy, or a European.
</li>

</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
As long as the player is learning or having fun.
